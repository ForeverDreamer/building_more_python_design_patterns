You work for a digital media company.  You've recently been given an assignment to build a 
program to retrieve and display current updates from Twitter.  You know you will need the 
twitter package, so you run:

pip install twitter

which works fine.  You also will need Twitter credentials, so you visit the page at 

https://apps.twitter.com/app

to set those up.  Now all you need to do is write the code!
