Your organization, like many, is organized as a hierarchy, with a CEO at the
top, several intermediate levels of VPs, directors and managers.  Then there's
you, at the bottom!

You are given a task to produce a tree representing this hierarchy.  To get 
started, you simulate this with a simple binary tree. You need to produce a way
to iterate over this tree, depth-first.

The tree.py file contains a basic Tree class and a Node class to use for the
employees.  Enhance this file to iterate over the tree as required

The file testtree.py builds a test tree using a tuple of integers.  Feel
free to make these names if you like.
