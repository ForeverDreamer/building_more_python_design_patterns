You are a consultant called to help automate a bakery.  This particular bakery
is famous for two things: its breads and its cakes.

You start off creating a Bread class and Cake class to represent these products.
As you do though, you begin to see some duplication of preparation steps and 
of course the final baking in the oven.

Use the Template Method pattern to standardize the baking steps and achieve As
much code reuse as possible.
